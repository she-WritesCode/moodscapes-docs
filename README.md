## 🎯 We Need Your Help with Prioritization

As a stakeholder, your feedback is critical in deciding **what we build first**. We use a community-driven prioritization model.

### How to Vote and Comment

At the very bottom of every specification page, you will see a **Discussion Board**.

1. **Sign In:** Click "Sign in with GitHub" in the comment box if you aren't already logged in.
2. **Leave a Comment:** Read through a module (e.g., the [Budget Module](08_V2_BUDGET_MODULE.md)) and write a comment at the bottom telling us if you think it is a high, medium, or low priority for our users. You can also suggest missing features!
3. **Upvote:** If another stakeholder has already left a comment that perfectly matches your thoughts, you can just click the **👍 Upvote** reaction on their comment to cast your vote!

We will use the total number of comments and upvotes on each page to finalize our V2 development roadmap. Let us know what you want to see come to life first!
