# Moodscapes V2 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## The Vision

**Moodscapes reduces wedding planning overwhelm by transforming a static checklist into a personalized, proactive "Wedding OS" (Operating System).**

Instead of just telling couples _what_ to do, Moodscapes hands them the exact, interconnected tools they need to _do it_—right when they need them.

## The Target User

Engaged couples (primarily brides) who feel overwhelmed by the enormity of wedding planning. They want guidance without high-pressure sales tactics, personalization without complexity, and a single, beautifully designed place to track their entire wedding journey.

## Where We Are Today (The MVP)

In our current Version 1 (MVP), Moodscapes successfully solved the "blank page" problem.

**What is working today:**

- Users can answer a few onboarding questions to instantly generate a personalized, AI-driven wedding plan.
- The app successfully breaks down a massive 12-month timeline into digestible, **week-by-week tasks** so users don't panic.
- The AI acts as a helpful text-based guide that users can chat with for advice.

**The Current Limitation:**
While our MVP tells you _what_ to do (e.g., "Set a budget for the florist"), the user still has to leave the app to actually do it (by opening a Google Sheet, hopping on Pinterest, or texting their partner). The MVP is a great list-maker, but it is not yet an execution engine.

## Where We Are Going (The V2 "Wedding OS")

In Version 2, Moodscapes evolves from a "Checklist App" into a true **Planning Platform**. We are building the interconnected tools couples usually patch together themselves.

Here are the 5 core pillars of the V2 expansion:

### 1. Interactive Subtask "Portals"

Tasks are no longer just text. If a weekly task is "Book the Photographer," the subtasks inside it act as "Portals" to other parts of the app. Tapping "Find inspiration" opens the Mood Board. Tapping "Review budget" slides up the Budget Tracker. Users execute the work right inside the task.

### 2. The Core Planning Modules

We are introducing dedicated, native tools to keep the user inside the Moodscapes ecosystem:

- **Budget Tracking:** Visual envelope budgeting with payment reminders.
- **Vendor Directory:** A CRM to discover, shortlist, and hire local professionals.
- **Guest Management:** A unified roster that effortlessly handles RSVPs for multiple cultural events spanning different days.
- **Vision Board:** A beautiful, filterable masonry grid to save inspiration.
- **Unified Calendar:** A central timeline with Two-Way Google Calendar sync to prevent double-booking.

### 3. A Proactive AI Assistant

The AI gets a major promotion. Instead of just giving text advice, it is now context-aware. If you ask it to "Remind me to pay the DJ next Friday", it will literally generate a tappable Calendar Event right inside the chat window for you to save.

### 4. Multiplayer Collaboration

Wedding planning is a team sport. V2 introduces a "Workspace" model. The primary user can securely invite their Partner to share the load, or invite their hired Professional Coordinator to view the calendar and assign tasks.

## How We Will Measure Success

We will know V2 is successful when we see:

1. **Increased Session Length:** Users spend more time inside the app because they are actively managing their budget/guests, rather than just checking off a daily task and leaving.
2. **High Module Adoption:** The percentage of active users who utilize at least 3 of the 5 new core modules (Budget, Vendors, Guests, Calendar, Vision).
3. **Collaboration Growth:** The average number of invitations sent per wedding, proving the app is valuable enough to share with partners and professionals.
